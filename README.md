## About the Project

The code in this repository contains data about every UFO visit to earth via a local hosted javascript based website. Run the index.html file to gain access to the local database loaded into a javaScript table which can be filtered by the date of the UFO sighting. If a new sighting occurs, the data.js file will automatically append it to the website table.
